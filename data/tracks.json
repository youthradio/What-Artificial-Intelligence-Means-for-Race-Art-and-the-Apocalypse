We're already at the service of automation, and I think the question that always, always, always comes up with automation, is not like if automation is good or bad.

One case that really worries me is in Baltimore. During protest of Freddie Gray's death, Baltimore police used facial recognition to identify protesters.

The computer will literally not know anything that isn't in the dataset that's been presented to it. So that data becomes extremely important for all of these things.","speaker":"alexis"},{"start":"1900-01-01T08:00:21.638Z","end":"1900-01-01T08:00:57.605Z","passage":"There was a study released where we evaluated the commercial facial recognition systems that were deployed. And we said, you know, how well does this system work for different intersectional demographics? So how well does it work for darker skinned woman versus lighter skinned woman versus darker skinned men and lighter skinned men? And it figures that there was a 30 percent performance gap between lighter skinned men and darker skinned men, which is insane for reference. You know, usually you don't deploy a system that's performing at less than ninety five percent accuracy. \n","speaker":"deb"},{"start":"1900-01-01T08:00:57.605Z","end":"1900-01-01T08:01:28.453Z","passage":"The way that these models perform actually changes based off of who you are, and that's super problematic. You know, if you're a darker skinned person, you're actually more at risk of being misclassified. And for certain products that are used by law enforcement, that are used by immigration, that are used in military situations, it becomes a safety risk to be a darker skinned person because you're less likely to be classified properly.","speaker":"deb"},{"start":"1900-01-01T08:01:28.453Z","end":"1900-01-01T08:02:00.636Z","passage":"Another example of bias comes from some software that's used in many U.S. courtrooms. It gives people a rating of how likely they are to commit another crime. And it was found that this software has twice as high a false positive rate on black defendants compared to white defendants. So that means it was predicting that people were high risk even though they were not being rearrested. And so this is something that's really impacting people's lives because it was being used in sentencing decisions and bail decisions.
