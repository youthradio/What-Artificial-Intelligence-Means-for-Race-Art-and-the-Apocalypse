Popular media does an amazing job creating elaborate storylines about how A.I. will take over the world (and we're not necessarily saying it won't). But the thing is, A.I. is already working *all the time, *on the very device you’re using this minute. Whenever your phone or computer thinks and performs like a human — when it predicts your tastes, recognizes your face, knows where you’re going — that’s Artificial Intelligence. And it’s everywhere.</p>\n<p>To find out how A.I. is changing the world, for better and worse, we talked to four experts: the conceptual Internet artist Sam Lavigne, tech writer Alexis Madrigal, engineer/analyst Deborah Raji, and data ethics advocate/developer Rachel Thomas. They all see us becoming increasingly reliant on A.I. systems in ways that impact our autonomy, creativity, society and the very experiences and identities that make us human.</p>","slug":"introduction"},"about":{"title":"About this Project","text":"<p>Twee everyday carry four dollar toast, selvage fanny pack echo park leggings lumbersexual cardigan scenester artisan stumptown.

They purposefully make it impossible to read.\nI think it is important for all of us to start thinking about where our data goes. That being said, even though I do take a glance at the terms of service, I probably click yes just as often as you do. So I end up in the same boat as you probably.\nI'm just more aware of my own doom.</p>"},{"name":"Ariel Tang","text":"<p>So AI gets a bad rap, especially when people make comparisons to Black Mirror and shows like that.

This is everything that I talk about, to be honest.\nI am really passionate about the fact that we shouldn't be worried about AI or robots taking over humans, mostly because robots are very good at certain things and humans are very good at certain things. You know, we experience rich emotions. We have an emotional intelligence that a machine does not have. We understand it. We can read each other's emotions and detect each other's emotions very easily. \nBut also, our perceptive abilities are unparalleled. So we can figure out the difference between a cat and a dog at the age of 0 years old. You can point out the difference. And it's incredible. And it's something that's a very uniquely human skill. \nComputers, though, have much more memory than we do.\nSo if you think about rote memorization, if a computer has to do a biology test where it's just like turn it in and turn it out, the computation allows for this kind of ability of storing that information and combining it logically in a way that humans might struggle with. So I think computers are very good at these complex calculations. They're very good at rote memorization or these standardized tasks that don't change or don't have a lot of variance, but might be difficult for a human to consistently do well.\nThink about, you know, music and art and we invent things. And it's beautiful. It's awesome. And I think we have an appreciation for art and literature and poetry. And I think that's a very uniquely human thing.</p>"}],"slug":"in-dialogue"},{"title":"In Dialogue","subtitle":"with Sam Lavigne","key":"sam-lavigne","audio":[],"text":"<p>As a self-proclaimed “conceptual internet artist”, Sam Lavigne uses technology to create projects that explore topics such as criminal justice, surveillance, commodity, and automation to educate people on the dangers of putting public infrastructure into the hands of private tech companies.

You can't really do new things at the moment and it can only sort of like regurgitate and duplicate what you've told it to do. I don't think we'll ever see a truly, beautiful work of art made by a machine. I don't think we'll ever see such a thing as even a neutral or a just machine.\nSo, I think that's what we have to remember. These are tools and we should use them as tools and that’s what they're good at. We should also think that like there's certain spheres of social, political, economic sort of tasks that we should never assign to machines. \nI would never want bail recommendations, prison sentences or suspicions about where to send the police to be determined by machine.\nThere's just certain things that we should never do. We should never allow a computer to do-- not because the computer is going to take over--it's because the computer is going to reproduce the biases that you give it. And then it's going to make what effectively is a bad decision.</p>"},{"name":"Sydney","text":"<p>So in most sci-fi movies, AI is seen as a horrifying thing that will take over the world.

We're already at the service of automation, and I think the question that we need to be asking is not “Is automation good or bad?”, but “Who is the person or who is the group of people that are benefitting from automation?” \nAnd the most likely answer is that people who are already at the bottom are going to lose out more.

And this is not a metaphor. Imagine you follow like a thousand people on Instagram. Why is it that you see certain things first and certain things from certain people a lot and maybe less from other people? It's because there's an automated system that's trying to figure out what you should look at.\nIt means that the way that we connect with other people might actually have to go through an automated system and that our social relationships might be determined in some sense by these systems.\nIf you're on Tinder or something, why do you see certain people more than others? These are very consequential things in our lives. And they're (in) what we might call a “black box”. There's no way for you to know as a user of those systems why you see certain things where you get matched with certain people, why certain messages come before others. I guess the issue here, among many other issues, is there's no accountability.\nWhen I'm using a hammer, I want the hammer to do the thing I expect it to do. I don't want it to stop me mid-hammer and be like, you should try hammering something else. \nWhen you're using a computer, you want it to be reliable. You want to be able to expect and understand how it responds to you. To me, that's what a good tool is.
